## Description

When a user arrives at the home page, they can click "Take Notes" and they are taken to a new screen where the user is able to enter a task title and task description. When they click the save icon, the note is saved on the left side of the screen. At that time, the user can either enter more notes and save them or they can exit the program.

When the user creates a new task by entering the title and description, on the backend the task is assigned a unique task id via the uuid package.

## Installation

This application requires a package JSON, express, and uuid.
